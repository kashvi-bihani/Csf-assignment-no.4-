# Future Improvements

For my future improvements, I will Use Flexbox to manage alignment and spacing efficiently, and apply CSS Grid to structure sections of the page. Implement media queries for a mobile-first design, ensuring the layout adapts seamlessly to desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.In the future, I plan to enhance the project by adding more features and improving the overall user experience.
